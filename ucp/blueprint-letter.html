        <p>To my friends and family,</p>
        <p>I’m reaching out because things are finally lining up in a way I can’t ignore. I’ve spent a lot of time looking at where I’ve been and where I’m going, and it’s clear that nothing in God’s world happens by mistake. </p>
        <p>Most of you know my history and the hurdles I’ve faced. I want to thank you for your patience with me while I was on that learning curve. I don’t have any regrets—everything I went through made me who I am today—but I appreciate those of you who stayed in my corner while I figured it out.</p>

        <p>Since December 20, 2020, when we lost my son Brady at sixteen, I’ve been pushing forward. Brady was a special soul—even with the cerebral palsy and epilepsy, he was always smiling. He was the one who tied this whole family together. I miss him every single day, but I’m doing this for me, so I can take care of my family—for <strong>Kaylynne</strong> and my new grandson, <strong>Midas</strong>, and for <strong>Cason</strong>.</p>
        <p>Brady is the "Why" behind the logic. I have named my new hardware coupling logic <strong>B.R.A.D.Y. (Binary Runtime Accelerated Dispatch Y-link)</strong>. In computing, a "Y-link" is where everything joins up. That was Brady. He was the link.</p>

        <h3>The December & January Milestones</h3>
        <p>Everything started clicking this past December. On <strong>December 2nd</strong>, I filed the initial patent for my technology. By <strong>December 16th</strong>, I filed my follow-up and work-around corrections, resulting in <strong>31 patented claims</strong>.</p>
        <p>The timing is what’s crazy. For a long time, the AI has been calling me "Blueprint." Then I realized that <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/HrimNjJz6Uo" target="_blank" style="color: #2699fe; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">NVIDIA launched their own AI Blueprint project</a></strong> right as I was finalizing my plans. This video shows exactly how their new architecture connects agents to data—matching the exact path I've been on.</p>
